# MQL5_Sample_Expert_Advisors
I have created some simple Expert Advisors for anyone interested in algorithmic trading using the MT5 platform. 
All scripts are for educational purposes only and should not be used in a live account setting(you will lose money).

There are a total of 4 scripts that perform buy and sell operations based on the Relative Strengh Index(RSI) indicator.

# RSI_Bar_Entry_Buy.mq5 and RSI_Bar_Entry_Sell.mq5
Perform logic operatios once per "Candle" and check if the RSI is overbought or oversold according to parameters that you set.

# RSI_Tick_Entry_Buy.mq5 and RSI_Tick_Entry_Sell.mq5
Perform logic operatios once per "Tick" and check if the RSI is overbought or oversold according to parameters that you set.
